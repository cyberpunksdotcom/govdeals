This log captures major planning and implementation milestones, decisions, and outstanding questions.

## 2024-XX-XX
- Initialized planning repository structure (docs/, tasks/).
- Authored expanded project plan covering architecture, infrastructure, timeline, and delivery process.
- Established documentation and task management workflow placeholders.
- Outstanding: Confirm exact date, compliance findings, and finalize task backlog once requirements are validated.

## 2024-XX-YY
- Scaffolded FastAPI backend with fixture-based repository and health endpoint.
- Added static dashboard prototype with filtering and responsive layout.
- Authored quickstart and user guide documentation; updated project overview to include presentation layer.

## 2024-XX-ZZ
- Implemented query-parameter filtering (search, category, bid range, end-time windows) on the listings API.
- Added backend test suite covering repository filtering logic and endpoint validation; documented pytest workflow.
- Improved dashboard category selector to avoid duplicate options when falling back to sample data.
- Outstanding: Surface new backend filters in the UI and connect listings to a persistent datastore.

## 2024-XX-AA
- Wired the dashboard controls to the FastAPI listings endpoint so keyword, category, bid range, and close-window filters all execute server-side when the API is online.
- Added matching client-side filtering with debounce and a clear action to preserve usability when the app falls back to bundled sample data.
- Updated README, quickstart, user guide, and project overview to reflect the enhanced filtering experience and remaining integration work.
- Outstanding: Replace the fixture repository with the scraping pipeline output and persist listings in PostgreSQL for stateful filtering.
