# User Guide

This guide explains how buyers and analysts can use the GovDeals Opportunity Tracker to monitor auctions and evaluate deals efficiently.

## Overview

The tracker aggregates listings that match your saved searches and presents them in a responsive dashboard. Daily refreshes ensure you have the latest price, status, and availability details.

## Dashboard tour

### Filters panel

- **Keyword search** &mdash; Enter words or phrases to match against listing titles, descriptions, and locations.
- **Category selector** &mdash; Narrow results to a specific asset category, such as Vehicles, IT Equipment, or Heavy Equipment.
- **Bid range** &mdash; Set minimum and maximum bid thresholds to focus on listings within your budget.
- **Closing window** &mdash; Use the “Closing after” and “Closing before” controls to find auctions ending in a specific time range.
- **Clear filters** &mdash; Reset all criteria when you want to return to the full catalog.

### Listings grid

Each card summarises an auction:

- **Title** &mdash; Click to view more details.
- **Current bid** &mdash; Highlighted to quickly spot attractive pricing.
- **Ends** &mdash; Shows the localised end time to prioritise urgent lots.
- **Location** &mdash; Understand shipping or pickup logistics at a glance.
- **Description** &mdash; Key seller notes or asset conditions.
- **View on GovDeals** &mdash; Opens the original listing in a new tab for bidding.

When no listings match your filters, the dashboard displays guidance to adjust criteria.

## Daily workflow

1. **Morning review** &mdash; Open the dashboard and skim the default view for overnight additions.
2. **Apply filters** &mdash; Use saved keywords or categories that align with your acquisition strategy.
3. **Deep dive** &mdash; For promising listings, open the GovDeals page to review inspection reports or contact the seller.
4. **Log opportunities** &mdash; Record interesting lots in your acquisition pipeline (CRM, spreadsheet, etc.).
5. **Set reminders** &mdash; Note end times for high-priority auctions to avoid missing bids.

## Collaboration tips

- Share the dashboard URL with teammates to coordinate evaluations.
- Create shared saved-search JSON templates (future enhancement) to align on sourcing criteria.
- Use tags or notes (planned feature) to track ownership and next actions.

## Troubleshooting

- **Blank dashboard** &mdash; Ensure the backend API is running locally. Refresh the page after the service responds.
- **Stale data** &mdash; Confirm that the scraper pipeline has populated the repository or database with the latest listings.
- **Authentication errors** &mdash; Reserved for future releases. For now, the prototype is open access.

## Roadmap highlights

- Watchlist email summaries delivered daily.
- Market intelligence charts (bid history, sell-through rate, residual value estimates).
- Mobile-first layout for on-the-go review during site visits and auctions.
